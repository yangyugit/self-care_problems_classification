# A deep learning method for self-care problems classification using represent learning and focal loss

Propose a deep learning method consisted of two sub-deep neural networks for childrenâ€™s self-care problems classification. 
The first sub-deep neural network utilizes the triplet loss method to compress the dimensions of the feature and preserve the information as well as the correlation, simultaneously. 
The second sub-network employs a technology called focal loss to handle the class imbalance problem to further improve classification accuracy. 
The numerical tests show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art classification performance of the children's self-care problems.
