# A deep learning method for self-care problems classification using represent learning and focal loss

Highlights:

- Propose a deep learning method consisting of two sub-deep neural networks for the classification of children’s self-care problems. 

- The first sub-deep neural network utilizes the triplet loss method to compress the dimensions of the feature and preserve the information and the correlation, simultaneously. 

- The second sub-network employs a technology called focal loss to handle the class imbalance problem to improve classification accuracy further. 

- The numerical tests show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art classification performance of the children's self-care problems.

Files:

- The folder SCADI-Dataset contains the children's self-care problems data.

- The folder dim-XX contains the extracted XX dimensions of features. Ex. dim-20 represents the folder containing the extracted 20 dimensions of features. 

- data_view.py presents the statistic information. 

- ablation_experiment.py is the Python code of the ablation experiment.
